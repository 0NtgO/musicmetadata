Should be able to parse PRIV frames

Allow users calling code from a utf-8 / 16 encoded .js file to watch for events with a symbol in the name.

vorbis - use TRACKTOTAL as the second part of the track for the metadata, same with disc

work out what the minimum required version of nodejs

should we automatically close the file once parsing has finished?

genre is defaulting to an array for one value

any errors that occur while parsing should be caught and available
to the user through an event


should done only be emitted when parsing has finished successfully and not when theres an error?
