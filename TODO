Should be able to parse PRIV frames

Allow users calling code from a utf-8 / 16 encoded .js file to watch for events with a symbol in the name.

should done only be emitted when parsing has finished successfully and not when theres an error?

need to resize the ogg vorbis sample and remove all the audio data

if cleanup doesn't work it should always return the original value

support for flac
