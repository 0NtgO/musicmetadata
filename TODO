Should be able to parse PRIV frames

Allow users calling code from a utf-8 / 16 encoded .js file to watch for events with a symbol in the name.

work out what the minimum required version of nodejs is

should we automatically close the file once parsing has finished?

should done only be emitted when parsing has finished successfully and not when theres an error?

if cleanup doesn't work it should always return the original value

not all the tests are executing on cygwin

support multiple artworks

to make sure that the aliased events are the same as the metadata event we should emit
when the done event is raised

track and disk total should default to 0 if its not known

track and disk total should be num 1 of 2 and not an array
